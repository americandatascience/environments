# AI

The AI environments are each tailored for specific AI tools and SDKs. They include tools for general AI development like PyTorch, as well as those specifically designed for working with AI models and tools from Anthropic, Cohere, Fireworks, Langchain, Mistral AI, OpenAI, Perplexity, and Replicate. Each environment provides the necessary clients, tools, and libraries for efficient development and interaction with the respective AI models and APIs.

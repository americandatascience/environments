## Deep Learning and Tensors

The Deep Learning and Tensors environments are designed for specific deep learning libraries and tools. These include environments for PyTorch, JAX, TensorFlow, Hugging Face, and Fast.ai, each equipped with the necessary tools for efficient deep learning and tensor computations. They provide a streamlined experience for tasks such as training neural network models, high-performance numerical computing, and large-scale machine learning.

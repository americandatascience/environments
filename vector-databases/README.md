# Vector Databases

The Vector Databases environments are tailored for specific vector database tools and clients, including vectordb, pinecone, milvus, weaviate, raft, faiss, chroma, and qdrant. Each environment is equipped with the necessary libraries and tools for efficient interaction with the respective vector databases. They facilitate tasks such as vector search, analytics, and clustering of dense vectors.

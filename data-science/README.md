# Data Science and Machine Learning

The Data Science and Machine Learning environments are designed for a variety of data science tools and machine learning libraries. These include environments for xgboost, lightgbm, scikit-learn, scipy, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, numba, and cupy. Each environment is equipped with the necessary tools for efficient data analysis, machine learning model training, and numerical computations.
